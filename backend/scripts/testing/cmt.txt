feat: complete PostgreSQL integration and GraphQL API setup

## Summary
Transitioned from SQLite to PostgreSQL with Docker, established GraphQL API with authentication, and populated database with realistic test data for the Alerto24 emergency response system.

## Major Changes

### 1. Database Migration
- **Switched from SQLite to PostgreSQL**: Updated `config/settings.py` DATABASES configuration
- **Docker PostgreSQL setup**: Configured container with proper environment variables
- **Added PostgreSQL driver**: Installed `psycopg2-binary` for Django-PostgreSQL connectivity

### 2. GraphQL API Implementation
- **Configured GraphQL endpoint**: Set up `/graphql/` URL with CSRF exemption
- **Created comprehensive schema**: Built `config/schema.py` with:
  - Emergency and Provider queries
  - JWT authentication mutations (`tokenAuth`, `verifyToken`, `refreshToken`)
  - CreateEmergency mutation
- **Added GraphiQL interface**: Enabled GraphQL browser IDE for development

### 3. Data Models Enhancement
- **Emergency model**: Complete emergency reporting system with:
  - UUID primary keys, geolocation (latitude/longitude)
  - JSON fields for symptoms, patient info, attachments
  - Status tracking (pending → dispatched → arrived → resolved)
  - Priority levels and anonymous reporting support
- **Provider model**: Professional emergency responders with:
  - Service type classification (AMBULANCE, FIRE_TRUCK, POLICE_CAR, etc.)
  - Availability status system
  - Performance metrics (rating, response time, completed emergencies)
  - Location tracking and scheduling
- **Custom User model**: Extended AbstractUser with:
  - Emergency contacts and medical information (JSON fields)
  - User type classification (CITIZEN, PROVIDER, ADMIN, FIRST_RESPONDER)
  - Location tracking and notification preferences

### 4. Test Data Generation
- **Created realistic test data**: Scripts to populate database with:
  - 25+ emergency cases across multiple types (medical, fire, police, accident)
  - 8+ provider profiles with different service specializations
  - 10+ citizen users with emergency contacts and medical info
  - Admin user for system management
- **Geographically distributed**: Test data centered around Metro Manila coordinates
- **Status distribution**: Realistic mix of pending, dispatched, and resolved cases

### 5. Configuration Updates
- **Installed dependencies**: Added `graphene-django`, `graphql-jwt`, `psycopg2-binary`
- **Updated INSTALLED_APPS**: Added `graphene_django` and `graphql_jwt`
- **Configured GRAPHENE settings**: Schema path and JWT middleware
- **Set up authentication backends**: JWT + Django ModelBackend
- **Added health endpoint**: `/health/` for service monitoring

### 6. Testing & Validation
- **Created diagnostic scripts**: To verify GraphQL and PostgreSQL connectivity
- **Added comprehensive testing**: Endpoint validation, schema introspection, data queries
- **Test authentication**: JWT token generation and protected queries
- **Verified data integrity**: Checked model relationships and field validations

## Technical Details
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 18.1 via Docker container
- **API**: GraphQL with Django-Graphene and JWT authentication
- **Models**: Custom User model with JSON fields for flexible data storage
- **Location**: Float-based latitude/longitude (simplified from PostGIS PointField)
- **Testing**: Realistic Philippine Metro Manila coordinates and city names

## Files Added/Modified
- `config/settings.py` - Database, GraphQL, and app configuration
- `config/urls.py` - GraphQL endpoint routing
- `config/schema.py` - Complete GraphQL schema definition
- `emergencies/models.py` - Emergency reporting model
- `providers/models.py` - Emergency responder model  
- `users/models.py` - Custom User model with emergency features
- `scripts/testing/` - Diagnostic and test data generation scripts
- `requirements.txt` - Added GraphQL and PostgreSQL dependencies
- `docker-compose.yml` - PostgreSQL service configuration (optional)

## Next Steps Ready
- GraphQL API accessible at `/graphql/`
- JWT authentication working
- Realistic test data populated
- PostgreSQL connection verified
- Admin interface at `/admin/`
- Health check endpoint at `/health/`

## Migration Notes
- Previous SQLite data needs manual migration if required
- All new features backward compatible with existing codebase
- Authentication system ready for frontend integration
- GraphQL endpoints require trailing slash

This commit establishes the complete backend foundation for the Alerto24 emergency response platform with modern GraphQL API, PostgreSQL database, and comprehensive data models.
